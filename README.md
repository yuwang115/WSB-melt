# Sensitivity of Future Evolution of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin Ice Sheet to Grounding Line Melt Parameterizations

## Overview

This repository contains the mesh and implementation scripts used in the paper: **"Sensitivity of Future Evolution of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin Ice Sheet to Grounding Line Melt Parameterizations"** by Yu Wang et al.（2024）

In this study, we analyze the impact of different grounding line melt parameterizations on the future evolution of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin Ice Sheet. The files provided here will allow you to reproduce the results presented in the paper.

## Contents

- `Mesh/` - Contains Elmer/Ice mesh files used for simulations.
- `Scripts/` - Includes the Elmer/Ice model configuration files and scripts to set up and run the model.
